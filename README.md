# Database Performance Comparison

This project provides a UI to compare database operation speeds between MongoDB and PostgreSQL. It uses Owner and Pet entities to represent typical application data models.

## Overview

- Frontend built with **Svelte** in `/petfinder`
- Java backend API with Spring Boot in `/backend`
- Databases provisioned via **Docker Compose**:
  - MongoDB
  - PostgreSQL
- Supports creating test data and timing the following operations:
  - Insert
  - Find by name
- Provides visual result comparison with **D3 bar chart**

## Running the Project

To start the project:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the root directory with the `docker-compose.yml` file
3. Run `docker-compose up` to launch MongoDB, PostgreSQL
4. With a IDE of your choice start the Java Spring Application
5. In a separate terminal, navigate to `/petfinder`
6. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
7. Run `npm run dev` to launch the Svelte frontend on localhost
8. Access the app at `http://localhost:5173`

The homepage provides controls to:

- Specify insert or find operation
- Toggle between native MongoDB and MongoDB with references for object mapping
- Input parameters like amount to insert or name to find
- Display performance comparison chart with D3

    Owner ||--|{ Pet : Owns 
    Owner {
        string id
        string name
        int mana
    }
    Pet {
        string id 
        string name
        string type
        int age
        float weight 
        float height
    }

```


## Performance Results

- More details on the performance test flows

Excellent suggestion! Here is an updated "Areas for Enhancement" section focusing on expanding the frontend CRUD capabilities:

## Areas for Enhancement (Please PR🥺)

Some areas that could be expanded on:

### Frontend CRUD Functionality

- Support updating existing owners
- Implement deleting owners
- CRUD operations for pets
- Manage relationships between owners and pets

This would build out the Svelte frontend to have full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) coverage for interacting with the owners and pets test data.

Additional ideas could include:

- Visualize performance over time as additional records are inserted
- Compare indexing approaches like MongoDB compound indexes vs PostgreSQL B-trees
- Containerization of frontend and deployment optimizations
